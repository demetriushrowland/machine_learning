        "content": "The minimum of a polynomial occurs at the vertex of its graph. The x-coordinate of the vertex can be found using the formula x = -b/(2a), where a is the coefficient of x^2 and b is the coefficient of x.\n\nIn this case, a = 1.4 and b = -2.3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get x = -(-2.3)/(2*1.4) = 1.64/2.8 = 0.586.\n\nTo find the minimum value of the polynomial, we substitute this x-coordinate back into the polynomial. Evaluating the polynomial at x = 0.586, we get 1.4(0.586)^2 - 2.3(0.586) - 2.5 â‰ˆ -3.43.\n\nTherefore, the minimum of the polynomial is approximately -3.43.\n\nNone of the given options (A) 1.22, (B) 0.5, (C) 0.82, or (D) 1.72 are correct."

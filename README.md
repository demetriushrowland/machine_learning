In the folder BETEL, you will find a replication of the results of the paper "Bayesian Estimation and Comparison of Moment Condition Models" as well as an implementation on a new data set. I have summarized the paper in the pdf "Bayesian Inference for MCMs" and compiled a slideshow in "Bayesian Analysis of MCMs."

In the folder Compilation, you will find a gathering of several programs that implement various machine learning algorithms on simulated data sets. These include algorithms for dimension reduction, regression, classification and density estimation.

In the folder CVC, you will find a replication of the results for the paper "Deep Generative Markov State Models," as well as a summary of the paper and detailed description of its contents under "Summary and Abstract."
